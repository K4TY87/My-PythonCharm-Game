# My-PythonCharm-Game
This is a very simple, yet fully functioning *random* game using Python and Python Charm. 
This game started very basic, with only 1 level of difficulty and simple 'higher' or 'lower' clues.
As i progressed with the language and code, i decided to add 3 levels of difficulty 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Hard'.
I then implemented additional clues which state how far away from the correct number you are. These include 'You're warm!', 'You're getting warmer.' and 'You're cold.'.

Here is a snippet of my game.
